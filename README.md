#Codecademy_Projects

This is a place where I, /Pancak3e a.k.a /sys4dmin will be uploading projects from coding
projects on Codecademy. This is strickly a place to show off what I, as a creater, am learning
and to potentially help others, that come accross this, in their coding journey as well.

I will be adding version numbers to the top of each file I commit here, as I do intent to show
where my first ideas were, to solve the project and if the project opens my creativity further
I will be expaning on these later, in different versions, of the same project.

I hope you enjoy, and please if you wish to reach out to me, please do, I would love to hear your criticism
